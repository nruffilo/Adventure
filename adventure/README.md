# This is a JSON/Property file driven game.  All adventures are in the CommonAdventures.js file.
The following attributes are needed for each adventure:

Type: ["story" or "combat"]
FOR STORY:
heading: The heading for the story
story: The text displayed when that adventure begins
reward: An array of objects.  Each object will have a "stat" and a "value".  The stat relates to the user object and gives an increase or decrease in any stat.
actions: An array of actions with a "text" and "action"  The action is a text value that directly points to the name of your adventure in the CommonAdventures.js file.  Actions can have conditions (a minimum stat required to see it as an option) as well as a random chance to display.  Condition of type "random" will give a random chance to display.  You can also have the outcome of an action be random (the value is the minimum roll value out of 100);
Encounters: A story can have random actions that happen when first encountering an adventure.  They have a % chance which is their key.  Everything is based on a 100% scale.  An encounter can take a user to a different action, or can provide a reward.


For Combat see the "ogre" for reference.  A combat adventure will spawn a new combat.

If you want an adventure to be available randomly through the "Adventure" button you need to add it to the AdventureList variable.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
